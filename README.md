# posthog-js-lite

The next generation of PostHog client libraries within the JS/TS ecosystem.

The lofty goals of this codebase is to solve the core client logic of our various JS based libraries in one place (web, node, React Native).

The short-term goal is to have a dedicated React Native library free from any platform-specific installations (the previous client library is a wrapper for the `posthog-ios` and `posthog-android` libraries). This enables a few things:

1. Installation to Expo managed projects without any separate compilation / ejecting
2. Tighter integration to RN enabling hooks, context, autocapture etc.
